### CEAUL2022

This report describes the work performed during the one-month research
fellowship for R&D initiation (BII) on the project “Statistical activity in
the assessment of water quality” within the project Verão Com Ciência
2022 (3982) with Prof. Clara Cordeiro (FCT–UAlg and CEAUL), Dra.
Sónia Cristina (UAlg–CIMA) and Prof. Soraia Pereira (FCUL and CEAUL)
through the Center of Statistics and its Applications of the University of
Lisbon (CEAUL).
The work is divided into four steps, in which the initial steps include the
importation of the data to the R software, following up an exploratory analysis
through statistical summary, identification of extreme values (outliers)
and time series to observe the variation of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla),
sea surface temperature (SST), nutrients, North Atlantic oscillations
(NAO) and upwelling index (UI; São Vicente and Cadiz) over the
18 years of data in the South coast of Portugal (off Sagres and Guadiana).
The exploratory analysis also includes the identification of seasonality and
the use of functions to remove it, such as stl.fit and decompose. All these
steps are studied for both Guadiana and Sagres. The last step during this
research fellowship includes the evaluation and interpretation of generalized
linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs). This step
will only be studied for Sagres site.
The goal of this work is to verify statistically which variables best model
chlorophyll-a.

### IGC2021

Final presentation for the work done at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.
I utilized the ZeroCostDL4Mic project and Google Colab to
apply deep learning and machine learning models for
extracting data from bioimage microscopy.
